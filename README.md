# Applied Physics 187 - Photonics and Applied Optics
#### This repository contains programs I coded for my activities in my undergraduate class in Photonics and Applied Optics.

Each folder corresponds to one activity, and contains four important files or set of files:

### 1. Activity Guide
The Activity Guides were created and sent to us by our professor to serve as our theoretical background and instructions for each activity.

### 2. Activity Results and Discussion
The Results and Discussion are .pdf files containing all the final output plots and diagrams of each activity. 
They also contain short discussion explaining how I obtained each figure, and what each figure means.

### 3. Jupyter Notebook
Each activity folder contains one or more Jupyter Notebook containing the codes (in Python) I used for the activity.

### 4. Datasets
Activity folders contain test images, .csv files, .xlsx files, and/or other data I used as input to the code/s.
